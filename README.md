# Learn and Build Intern Assessment CRUD Application

This is my assessment project repository in which I created a MERN stack web application. The app includes a login/signup form and two pages: 

1. **Login/Signup Page**: Where users can log in or sign up.
2. **Home Page**: Where users can update, view, or delete their profiles. Below the userâ€™s profile, the details of all other users are listed as asked in assesment.

## To Run This Project

### 1. Download the repository and extract it. Then, navigate to the project folder.

#### Running the Frontend:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

#### Running the Backend:
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder inside the project folder.
2. Open the terminal in that path.
3. `npm install`
4. `node server.js`

**Note**: You will need to set up the environment variables. The `.env` file should contain:
- A **JWT key** for password encoding
- A **MongoDB connection string**

## Design

For the website's base design, I used **Figma** (image below).
